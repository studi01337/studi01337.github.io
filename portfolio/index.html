          <li><span>Kal.io (for calendar) is a dead simple visual time scheduler where you can seamlessly book resources and assign them to other shared resources. UX is the primary goal of this project, and the calendar is designed to render on very small devices. Kalio is mainly used by flight schools. It's so easy that pilots can safely book planes on their phones while flying the aircraft :) (tested myself)</span></li>

          <li><span>Roadzila is a European B2B tires marketplace. I'm proud of my tailor made catalog :) 700&nbsp;brands over 80,000&nbsp;references, with a total stock of around 15&nbsp;millions&nbsp;tires. Roadzila uses bleeding edge technologies in its market, also it's currently the only company providing a standard HTTP API consumed by major international tires manufacturers and brokers.</span></li>

              <p>It started with an online safe space for families to organize and commemorate the loss of their loved ones.</p>
              <p>I've built the entire service from scratch. I architected and implemented custom software, enhancing (10x?) the funeral workflows, redefining the funeral business from the ground up.</p>
              <p>5 years, 60 employees in &amp; out, and a 20M€ B series later, the company extended its model to physical funeral services. Due to unethical practices and pressure at the top, being the only independent individual in the new employee/resource model corp, it was ironically time for me to end my collaboration with the project I fully crafted :)</p>
              <p>Huge respect for the people working with the families. I hope my work improves the quality of your time. It came from my gut &amp; my heart. </p>

              <p>Markdown publishing framework, as a service !</p>
              <p>The <code>kit</code> renders markdown into any kind of web application, and with the use of plugins and declarative syntax, you can customize every aspect of your pages, in seconds!</p>
              <p>The kit renders your content into static HTML pages, inside a folder, that can be hosted anywhere.</p>
              <p>Project documentations, blogs, wikis, digital gardens, academia, table-top games, shops... The kit just seats on top of your content, and gives you full control over the UI &amp; UX.</p>
